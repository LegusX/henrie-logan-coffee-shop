To whomever is grading this:

You may have noticed the latest commit is well past the submission deadline. The reason for this is I've just now gotten the feedback for our previous project, the Travel Site, and have learned that my paths don't work unless served from a web server, which it appears you are not using for grading. As such this commit only contains changes to paths. This is something I believe I would have fixed had I received the feedback for the previous project before submitting this one, which is why I am fixing it now. If you disagree, you are welcome to grade based on the previous commit, https://github.com/LegusX/henrie-logan-coffee-shop/commit/0471a3abf9694e87f1a80032e067d3d0a05c4c73 which was submitted before the deadline.

Anyways, thanks for your time.
